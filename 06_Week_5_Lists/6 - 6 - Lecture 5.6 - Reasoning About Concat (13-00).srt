1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,782
What does it mean for a function program
to be correct?

2
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:11,825
One possible answer would be that the
definitions in the program satisfy certain

3
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:15,167
laws.
Often these laws are represented as

4
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:20,580
equalities between terms.
In this session and the next, you're going

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,446
to see proof techniques that can show that
a given set of operations satisfy certain

6
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,761
laws.
The material in these two sessions is an

7
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:36,228
important dimension of functional
programming because it demonstrates one of

8
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:40,275
the core claims of FP,
Namely, that it is more amenable to

9
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:44,861
reasoning about programs.
On the other hand, the programming parts

10
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:50,026
in this course are not dependent on it,
and none of the assignments that we are

11
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:54,276
going to do will test this.
So, if you want to go fast, you can skip

12
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:59,115
the material in the next two sessions.
On the other hand, EPFL students are

13
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:04,738
required to learn this material because it
will be used in the physical exams that we

14
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:09,576
do here at EPFL.
Recall the concatenation operation plus,

15
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:13,173
plus on lists.
What would it mean to say that plus, plus

16
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,632
or the version concat that we've written
is correct?

17
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:22,166
When one criterion for correctness would
be to say that plus, plus satisfies

18
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,025
certain laws that we would expect from
concatenation.

19
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:31,560
The laws are that concatenation is
associative, so I can put the parentheses

20
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,365
here either to the left or to the right of
a double concatenation,

21
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,497
And that Nil is right unit and a left
unit.

22
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:45,176
That means, for any list xs, xs followed
by Nil is xs, and Nil followed by xs is

23
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,070
second xs.
The question is,

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,070
Given properties like these, how can we
prove them?

25
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,174
And the answer is, by a new proof
principle that we're going to introduce

26
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:59,390
now which is called structural induction
on lists.

27
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:05,333
So to introduce structural induction, it's
good to first look at its close sibling

28
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:09,318
natural induction.
Natural induction is a proof principle

29
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,842
that you apply when you want to proof
something for all integers greater or

30
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:20,070
equal some smallest integer b.
The idea there is that to show a property

31
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,032
that the property will hold for all such
integers, you just need to show that it

32
00:02:26,032 --> 00:02:29,833
holds for the smallest element, b, for the
base case,

33
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:35,150
And then for all other integers, you need
to show the induction step.

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,502
The induction step is that if you have P
of n, if you assume P of n, then you can

35
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:47,379
conclude that P of n plus one also holds.
If you have proven that, then, the

36
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:53,652
principle of natural induction says that
the property P holds for all integers

37
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:58,865
greater or equal to b.
So, here's an example to recap natural

38
00:02:58,865 --> 00:03:02,482
induction.
We are looking again at factorial.

39
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,100
So here's the usual definition of
factorial.

40
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,489
And we want to show that for all n greater
or equal to four, we have that factorial

41
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,799
of n is greater or equal to the power of
two to the nth.

42
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,650
So, instead of power, we also could use
the mathematical notation two to the nth.

43
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,925
So, we do that by proof of natural
induction.

44
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:30,690
The base case obviously is n4.
= four, that's the smallest number we have

45
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,413
to consider,
And there we can just do it by simple

46
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,358
calculation.
Factorial of four is 24, and power of two

47
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:42,152
to the fourth is sixteen, 24 is greater
than or equal to sixteen.

48
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:46,995
So, the case is established.
For the induction step then, we assume

49
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:53,810
that the property holds for n. So, we
would assume that factorial of n is

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,760
greater or equal to twonth.
To

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,802
The nth, and we have to prove the same
thing for n plus one.

52
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:07,495
So, let's see what we do.
Factorial of n plus one is equal, or here,

53
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:13,127
if we've widened that to greater or equal
two n plus one times factorial of n,

54
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,376
because that's how we have defined
factorial,

55
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:20,420
That's just in second clause in the
factorial definition.

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,017
And that is definitely greater than two
times factorial n because we know that n

57
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:30,440
is greater equal to four, so n plus one is
greater equal to five.

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,688
And finally, by the induction hypothesis,
we know that two times factorial n is

59
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:42,936
greater or equal than two times power of
two to the nth, because our induction

60
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:49,425
hypothesis was that factorial of n is
greater or equal to power of two to the

61
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,029
nth.
And we can use that induction hypothesis

62
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:57,515
freely in our proof.
So finally, in the last step, we just

63
00:04:57,515 --> 00:05:04,400
simplify power, so, two times two to the
nth is, as we know, the same as two to the

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,265
n plus one.
So, this is power two to the n plus one

65
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:11,590
and that's precisely what we want to
prove.

66
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,620
Factorial n plus one is proven to be
greater or equal to power of 2n plus one.

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,842
So, it follows that the property holds for
all integers n greater equal to four.

68
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:28,925
So, one thing we've used here implicitly
and quite liberally is that we have

69
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:32,670
applied reduction steps as equalities to
parts of terms.

70
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,511
So, we have used a reduction in our proof
of saying left-hand side equals right-hand

71
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:41,196
side.
That works because pure functional

72
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:46,299
programs don't have side effects, so
reducing a term is really equivalent to

73
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:50,059
rewriting that term.
There's no other effect to be taken

74
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:53,281
account of.
That principle is called referential

75
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:56,705
transparency,
It's an important tool for equational

76
00:05:56,705 --> 00:06:01,365
proofs of functional programs.
So, let's look at structural induction

77
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,499
now.
The principle of structural induction is

78
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:09,164
analogous to natural induction.
The idea is that we want to prove a

79
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:13,968
property, P, for all lists, xs.
And to do that, we just need to show that

80
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,728
P of the empty list holds,
That would be the base case.

81
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:23,090
And that second, for any list xs and any
element x, we show the induction step

82
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,529
which says, assume P of the list xs holds,
then you need to show that P of x followed

83
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,119
by the list xs also holds.
So, instead of constructing numbers

84
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:40,336
starting from a base case and adding one,
we construct lists starting from the empty

85
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:44,260
list and consing elements to the top of
the list.

86
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,827
So, back to our comcat example.
We'd like to show that, for any lists xs,

87
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:55,246
ys, zs, concatenation is associative.
That means, we can put the parentheses

88
00:06:55,246 --> 00:07:00,666
here to the left or to the right.
To do this, we use a structure induction

89
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:06,011
on the list xs.
From the previous implementation of concat

90
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:11,059
that you see here, we can distill two
defining clauses for plus, plus.

91
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:17,740
We can say, well, if the first element xs
is Nil and is followed by a list ys, then

92
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,715
we get ys here.
And the second clause would say, well, if

93
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:27,229
the first list is x followed by xs1, and
then ys, then the answer would be x

94
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,464
followed by the concatenation of xs1 and
ys.

95
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:35,978
So, these two clauses here, they're
directly derived from the implementation.

96
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:39,875
Essentially, they codify what the
implementation does.

97
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,110
So, lets now look at the structure
induction.

98
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,860
The best case would be that our list xs
equals Nil.

99
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,864
So here, we would have, for the left-hand
side, of our equation Nil, followed by ys,

100
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:59,347
followed by zs. And that can simp, can be
simplified to just ys, followed by zs.

101
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:05,325
Why? Because of the first clause of plus,
plus which says, Nil, followed by ys is

102
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,697
ys.
Let's look at the right-hand side of the

103
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:15,211
equation, there we would have Nil follow
up by, the parenthesis to the right, ys

104
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:18,583
and zs.
But, of course, again, we can evoke the

105
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,645
first clause of plus, plus and simplify to
ys plus za.

106
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:27,550
So, we have an equality here, and here,
and the cases is established.

107
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,532
So, let's now turn to the induction step.
As the left most list, we would have x

108
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:39,846
followed by xs, and then ys, and then zs,
and the left-hand side has all parenthesis

109
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:43,040
going to the left.
How can we simplify that?

110
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,782
Well, one thing we can do is, we can pull
the x out of the parenthasis with the xs.

111
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:53,532
So now, xs would go with ys,
And the x would be outside of that list.

112
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:58,990
That we can do by the second clause of
concat which says, concatinating a list

113
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:05,229
that starts with x is a list that starts
with x and contanition of the rest of the

114
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:08,206
list.
So, it was the second clause of concat

115
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:12,093
that said that.
Once we have that, what's the next step?

116
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:17,958
Well, x is still within another head list,
so we can involved the second clause of

117
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:23,456
concat again.
And now, we would have x leading the whole

118
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:28,603
result of the concatination.
So, what's the next step?

119
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:34,423
Well, the next step would be that, look
here, what you see is xs followed by ys,

120
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:38,682
followed by zs.
That's actually the left-hand side of our

121
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:44,361
induction hypothesis which says, assume
you have proven the equation already for

122
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:48,478
the list xs.
So, we can invoke the induction hypothesis

123
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:53,730
and rewrite this expression here to the
expression on the right-hand side.

124
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,276
So, parenthesis here, now go to the right.
And that's all we're going to do with the

125
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,691
left-hand side.
Let's now turn to the right-hand side.

126
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:07,137
So here, we would have the parenthesis go
to the right, ys and zs, let's

127
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:10,810
concanatinate it and then we have on the
left x followed by xs.

128
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,256
What can we do with that expression?
Well, one thing we can do is, again,

129
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:20,540
involve the second clause of plus, plus to
pull out the X from the first list here,

130
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,739
And that gives x followed by xs, followed
by ys and zs.

131
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:30,416
And that is exactly the same as what we
simplified the left-hand side to.

132
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,460
So, the case and with it the property is
established.

133
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,470
Let's do an exercise.
Let's look at the second law for concat,

134
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,810
namely that Nil is the right unit for xs.
Can you show by induction that, that law

135
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,646
holds?
And how many equations do you need for the

136
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,230
inductive step?
Two? Three? Or four?

137
00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:01,240
So, let's see how we would prove this.
Let's do the base case first.

138
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,223
So, the base case would be that the list
xs equals Nil.

139
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:19,676
Then we have on the left-hand side, Nil
plus, plus Nil, and that is the same as

140
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:30,229
Nil by the first clause of concat, and
that is already what we need.

141
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:38,211
So, we have a when, if xs equals Nil, xs
plus Nil is the same as xs.

142
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:46,656
So, let's have a look at the induction
step. That will be x followed by xs.

143
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:55,486
So, what we need to prove is that x
followed by xs plus, plus Nil, that should

144
00:11:55,486 --> 00:12:03,689
be the same as x followed by xs.
So, how would we go about that? Well, we

145
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:13,180
have x inside a, a com, a cons here, so we
can involve the first clause of plus, plus

146
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:19,273
to put it out.
So, that would be the x followed by xs

147
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:31,662
plus, plus Nil. Second clause.
And that can be simplified to just x

148
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:41,772
followed by xs by the induction hypothesis
because we know we can be allowed to

149
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:49,495
assume that xs followed by Nil is xs,
And that is what we wanted to achieve

150
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:52,568
here.
So, we have established the case.

151
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:59,626
So, the answer to the question was, we
need two steps to establish the inductive

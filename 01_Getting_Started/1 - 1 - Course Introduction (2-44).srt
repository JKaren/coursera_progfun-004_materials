00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,051
Welcome.
I'm going to give you now a quick

2
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:08,033
introduction of my course, Functional
Programming Principles in Scala, and tell

3
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:12,089
you how we are going to organize it.
As usual, the course will consist of a

4
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,095
sequence of videos which will introduce
the elements of the course one by one, and

5
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:22,089
the videos will also have quizzes where
you are asked to fill in some questions.

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:27,052
Those questions could be multiple choice
or also, quite often, we ask you to

7
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:31,022
program something.
After the quizzes, you will always see the

8
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:34,067
answer in the videos.
Besides the quizzes, there are also

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:38,005
assignments.
The assignments you have to hand in, and

10
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,795
you are going to be graded on the
assignments.

11
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:45,622
And if you pass the assignments, then you
will get a certificate at the end of the

12
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:48,506
course.
The quizzes, by contrast, they are just

13
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,165
for your own education.
You are not going to be graded on them.

14
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:56,693
There's a timeline for the course.
You can expect a new set of videos every

15
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:59,641
Tuesday morning, and including a new
assignment.

16
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:04,479
And you will have one week to hand in the
assignments, or the assignments will have

17
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,365
to be handed in Monday night the following
week.

18
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:13,109
We're going to use for the programming in
the course the Eclipse, IDE, Integrated

19
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:18,021
Development Environment.
And, I will show you later on how you can

20
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:21,237
download the IDE and how you can install
it.

21
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:27,126
There's also another tool we meet for
handing in the assignments that's called

22
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:32,065
SBT, the Scala Build Tool.
Again, we will go through the details how

23
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:34,320
to get and to install SBT.
Okay.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,090
Once you are on the site, the first thing
you could do is go to Tools Setup.

25
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:47,047
Here, you'll see detailed setup
instructions how to setup Eclipse and SBT

26
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:52,001
for all the major operating systems,
Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

27
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:58,038
You could also simplify your life simply
by looking at one of the three videos that

28
00:01:58,038 --> 00:02:01,095
can tell you exactly what to do to get
started.

29
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:07,788
Once you've done that, you could go next
to Assignments, getting, going to get

30
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:12,855
started in the assignments.
And then you'll see an example assignment

31
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:17,098
which is optional.
We will grade it but it won't count

32
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:22,879
towards your points for the course.
That's essentially takes you through the

33
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,732
steps of drafting an assignment, drafting
an, an exercise submitting your solution

34
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:35,013
to the assignment so that then when we
start at the real assignments, you already

35
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:41,014
know all the mechanics for that.
That's all there is to know for now.

36
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:46,020
Have fun with the course and the
assignments.

00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,380
Hi there, in this video we're going to
show

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,870
you how to get started with Scala and
IntelliJIDEA.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,880
First of all you have to

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:14,570
download IntelliJIDEA from it's official
website JedPrice.com/idea.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,440
Notice that IntelliJIDEA comes in two
editions.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,140
Ultimate, the commercial one, and the
Community

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,128
Edition which is free and open source.

8
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:26,300
Support for Scala is fully available in
the Community Edition.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,390
Once the file is downloaded, go ahead and
open it.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,490
If you're using MAC OS X, simply drag the
application to the applications folder.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,500
If you're a Windows user, the built

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,690
in installer will guide you through the
process.

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,250
If you're a Linux user, just unzip the
package to any folder.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,110
When we run IntelliJIDEA for the first
time it offers us to import settings.

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,640
Here we don't have any previous
installments, so we simply skip this step.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,250
Now, before we create a Scala project or

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,274
open one, we have to download the Scala
plugin.

18
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:11,730
Click the Configure menu and then click
Plugins.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,130
Here we see the list of plugins already
installed.

20
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,890
To install additional JetBrains plugins,
click this button under the list.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,630
If you sort the list of plugins by the
number of

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,230
downloads, the Scala plugin is sure to be
at the top.

23
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:36,352
Select this Scala plugin and click to
install it.

24
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:38,860
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,780
After the plugin is downloaded you will be
offered to restart the IDE.

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,950
Make sure you do.

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,480
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,890
Now, let's see how to create a

29
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,040
simple Scala application and run it using
IntelliJIDEA.

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,340
Choose the Create New Project menu and
select Scala Project Type.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,120
Since we're going to use SBT as the build
tool, choose the SBT option.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,890
Notice that when you create a Scala
project, you have to choose a project SDK.

33
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,950
If you have no Java SDK configured, click
the New

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,240
button and choose the home directory of
your Java SDK.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,920
Every time the project is being loaded,
you have a chance to

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,040
pick up a few tips and tricks on how to
use the ID.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,190
When you run the IDE for the first time,
it

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,860
shows you how to open the Tool Windows
hidden by default.

39
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,770
You can access Tool Windows using the
button in the bottom left-side corner.

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,430
The IDE has created an empty Scala project
with Java and Scala source roots.

41
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,710
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,970
Let's create a class and define a method
there returning a hello string.

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,030
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,490
Since we want to be sure our code is

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,730
correct, we'll write an appropriate test
before implementing that method.

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,580
To do that we need to add a Scala test
library to the project.

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,220
Let's do it with the SBT file.

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,440
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,220
When we change SBT build files, the IDE

50
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,430
offers us to synchronize these changes
with a project.

51
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,350
Once we confirm to refresh the project, it
takes

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,838
a bit to download and configure the added
libraries.

53
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:37,054
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:42,030
As you can see, the Scala test library has
been added to the project.

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,320
Now we're back to the class.

56
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,410
Let's use the Navigate to Test action.

57
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,720
As we don't have any tests yet, the IDE
offers us to create one.

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,890
Let's name the test say hello method works
correctly.

59
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,822
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:03,490
Now I'll create a new instance of the
hello class.

61
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:13,160
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,560
Make sure the method returns hello Scala.

63
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,000
Now use the Context menu to run the test.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,340
As expected the test fails.

65
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,990
Time to implement the method.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,820
Run the test again and make sure it's
green.

67
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,630
Now I'll show you how to use Scala
Worksheets.

68
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,613
You can create one in the Scala source
root via the Context menu.

69
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:46,591
[BLANK_AUDIO]

70
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,520
Let's create a hello instance and call
it's method.

71
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,480
When the code is ready, click the Run
button on the tool bar.

72
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,080
The results appear almost immediately.

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,350
That's all for creating a new project, now

74
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,370
let's see how to import an existing
project.

75
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,985
Let's go to the Assignment Page

76
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:22,544
and download a sample project.

77
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:28,683
[BLANK_ AUDIO].

78
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:30,809
Then go to File > Import Project.

79
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:31,309
[BLANK_AUDIO]

80
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,790
And choose a Build.SBT file to import
from.

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,490
Confirm to open in the current window.

82
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,330
Sometimes it may take awhile to download
the libraries listed in the build file.

83
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,920
Once it's done we can explore the project
files.

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:09,730
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,780
Or run the tests.

86
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:20,780
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,840
Last but not least is the Terminal Tool
window.

88
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,088
It helps you access the Command Line
without leaving the IDE.

89
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:35,599
It is useful for

90
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:41,498
running SBT tasks,

91
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:47,757
among other things.

92
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,841
